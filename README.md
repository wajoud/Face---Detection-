# OpenVisionDetect 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **OpenVisionDetect**—your toolkit for mastering real-time face detection using OpenCV. This repository is designed to help developers implement advanced face recognition technologies in their applications, using robust models and clear, practical examples.

## 🎯 Mission
Our goal is to democratize face detection technology, making it accessible and easy to implement for developers across various sectors, from security to interactive media.

## 🌟 Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilize OpenCV to detect faces in real-time with high accuracy.
- **Customizable Models**: Adapt and tune pre-trained models for your specific use case.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Get started easily with our comprehensive guides and examples.

## 📂 Dataset

Our dataset is structured as follows to aid in training and testing the face detection model:

- **Know_face/wajoud**: Contains images used for training the detection model. These are the images the system will "learn" from.
- **Test**: Houses random images used to test the model's accuracy and performance in detecting faces.

## 🛠 Getting Started

Clone this repository to begin using the face detection tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wajoud/OpenVisionDetect.git
cd OpenVisionDetect
```
